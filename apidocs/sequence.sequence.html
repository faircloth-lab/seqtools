<p>These files (fasta.py, fastq.py, transform.py, sequence.py) contain code
and ideas derived from galaxy-dist 
(http://bitbucket.org/galaxy/galaxy-dist/src/). The original files were 
created by Dan Blankenberg.  See:</p>
<p>Blankenberg et al.  doi:  10.1093/bioinformatics/btq281</p>
<p>I have modified the original source, changing the way that quality 
scores are stored and used (all quality scores are stored as numpy arrays 
in sanger-spec integer (phred) values with methods to convert and display 
the array as a standard quality string).  I've added additional methods to 
several of the classes (e.g. trimming within sequence.SequenceRead - 
subclassed by both fasta and fastq), and I altered methods and class 
methods to use numpy methods within functions, for speed and where 
possible.  Finally, i slightly changed how fasta and fastq files are 
read.</p>
